This directory and its subdirectories contain images from the KDE project Oxygen: 
http://www.kde.org
https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen

These icons are licensed under LGPL v3 (see COPYING.LESSER).

The only exception is the InterText icon (files with the name "InterText.png" 
in different sizes and thus different subdirectories), which is part of 
InterText Editor and is covered by the GPL v3 license (or newer) 
like the rest of the software.
